We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it by following these steps:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2.  **Email us privately:** Send a detailed report to `chirag127@example.com` (This is a placeholder email. In a real-world scenario, this would be a dedicated security email or a link to a security reporting platform).

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

Once we receive a security report, we will:

*   Acknowledge the report within 48 hours.
*   Investigate the vulnerability promptly.
*   Determine the scope and impact.
*   Develop a fix and release it as soon as feasible.
*   Notify the reporter once the fix is deployed and provide credit where appropriate.

We aim to resolve all reported security issues transparently and responsibly, respecting the efforts of those who bring potential issues to our attention.
